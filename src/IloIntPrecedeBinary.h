/*
 * This constraint ensures integer value precedence of value s over value t across
 *     integer variable array X and proceeds to the appropriate filtering.
 * This constraint is useful for breaking value symmetries.
 * This constraint maintains Generalized Arc Consistency (GAC).
 * A sequence of precedence can be maintained by posting this constraint for each pair or values.
 * 
 * Main arguments: * X, integer variables over which precedence must be maintained.
 *
 * Additional arguments: * s, antecedent value.
 *                       * t, subsequent value.
 *
 * Note: posting on all pairs of values ensures strictly stronger
 *     filtering but is inefficient in practice and does not produce
 *     better results. Therefore, it is recommended to post on pairs 
 *     of adjacent values only.
 *
 * Implementation of the work of:
 * Law Y.C., Lee J.H.M. (2004) Global Constraints for Integer and Set Value Precedence.
